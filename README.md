## About the project

This repo contains the source code of a Machine Learning library for .NET development.

## Built with

* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

## Currently supported models

### Kohonen neural networks - Self-organizing map
This project implements the Self-organizing map model (also called Kohonen Neural Network). The algorithm implemented is adequate for any particular number of dimensions. You can find more information about Self-organizing maps in the original paper which is stored in the following [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/58325)

It must be mentioned that in the **/Examples** folder is presented a solution to the basic Travelling Salesman Problem using a Kohonen neural network. Which consists in finding an optimal route among n cities. In this [link](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy583/papers/ch11.pdf) is presented more information related to this problem.
